# get_next_line
Second 42 project


Purpose of this project is to read file from standart input and give back only text before \n.
Topics: using static variables

My aproach: 
To deal with large files I choose to read BUFF_SIZE, that was defined in header.
If I find \n in text - give back text before \n and add text, that left to static variable.
